# About the project
When the covid-19 spread, one of the ways to limit its spread was to were a mask, but not all people committed to wearing it or wearing it correctly.

- In the project we decided to build a real time system to detect by a camera, person who is not wearing a mask or not wearing it correctly, and if the person is found in our database the system was abke to recognize him, it will show his details and send him a mail to wear a mask.
